*“Love, it blinds, it renders one powerless control oneself.”*

Hera is a queen of the gods and she is married to Zeus. In a world where men are usually in charge, Hera is very loyal to her family and marriage. She is very strong and wants to protect the importance of marriage and family. Sometimes, she gets very angry at Zeus for being unfaithful to her. This makes her do things that cause fights between the gods and people.

On one hand, her jealousy and vindictiveness towards Zeus' numerous infidelities are well-documented in Greek mythology, and her actions, driven by these emotions, often lead to conflict and war among the gods and mortals.

On the other hand, Hera is still a good role model because she is very strong and always follows her beliefs. She is a great example of a strong woman in Greek stories. Even though she can be mean sometimes, her complex and sometimes vengeful personality made her a compelling and interesting character in Greek mythology.

In conclusion, Hera shows the qualities of strength, determination, and devotion, as well as the complexities of human emotions and flaws. Her presence in Greek mythology adds depth and richness to the pantheon of gods, and her influence will still continue to be show in the stories and legends forever.
